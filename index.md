## Experience

### __Tsinghua University, Speech Processing and Machine Intelligence Lab__  `2018.3 - 2018.6`
_Research Assistant_<br>
1)  Advised by prof. Xi Xiao, on __Software Development of GMM-HMM Speech Recognition Based on DSP__ project, implemented in __C++__.<br>
2)  Ported a GMM-HMM phrase speech recognition software from PC to DSP, developed several driver programs to communicate with peripherals    on a ADSP-21469 custom board.<br>
3)  Intergrated a new function which can communicate with PC through UART to transfer information and data.<br>
4)  Rewrote kernel recoginition functions in assembly language to improve the speed of software.

### __University of California, Los Angeles, Perceptual Processing and Computational Lab__ `2017.7 - 2017.9`
_Research Assistant_<br>
1) Worked with prof. Zili Liu, on __Computational Motion Processing__ project, a computational study on motion processing and learning in the brain, using support vector machines (SVM). <br>
2) Used the best possible SVM to conduct multivarite pattern analysis on our fMRI data from the entire MT, and finally proved that suppressed MT still could process directional information under motion opponency.

## Selected Projects

### __Social Network Analysis of Weibo Hot Topics Based on Python__ `2017.6`
Analysed the social relationship and feature of the users who followed a same hot Weibo(Chinese Twitter) topic, and conducted visualization of userâ€™s social relationship by drawing directed graph.

### __Software Development of Image Processing__`2017.5`
Designed a program with multiple functions as sharpening, smoothing and contrast enhancement, and rendered a GUI interface that enabled users to change parameters of image processing.

### __Real-time Action Recognition Based on Kinect__ `2017.5`
Collected human action information and defined the command for a certain posture, and completed the task of playing games with Kinect based on human motion recognition.

### __Kernel Porting of VAD Tree in Windows__ `2016.12`
Changed the VAD tree structure in the WRK source code from the AVL tree to a red-black tree, refer to Linux kernel code.

### __Music Synthesis System__ `2016.6`
Synthesized melody based on the existing music scores, and analyzed and imitated the sounds of different instruments.
