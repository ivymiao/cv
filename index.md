## Experience

### __Tsinghua University, Speech Processing and Machine Intelligence Lab__  `2018.3 - 2018.6`
_Research Assistant_<br>
- Advised by prof. Xi Xiao, on __Software Development of GMM-HMM Speech Recognition Based on DSP__ project
- Ported a GMM-HMM phrase speech recognition software from PC to ADI ADSP-21469 digital signal processor, and developed several driver programs to communicate with peripherals on a ADSP-21469 custom board.
- Intergrated a new function which can communicate with PC through UART to transfer information and data.
- Rewrote kernel recoginition functions in assembly languages to improve the speed of software.

### __University of California, Los Angeles, Perceptual Processing and Computational Lab__ `2017.7 - 2017.9`
_Research Assistant_<br>
- Worked with prof. Zili Liu, on __[Computational Motion Processing](https://zililab.psych.ucla.edu/research/computational-motion-processing/)__ project, a computational study on motion processing and learning in the brain, using support vector machines (SVM). 
- Used the best possible SVM to conduct multivarite pattern analysis on our fMRI data from the entire MT, and finally proved that suppressed MT still could process directional information under motion opponency.


## Selected Projects

### __Social Network Analysis of Weibo Hot Topics Based on Python__ `2017.6`
- Analysed the social relationship and feature of the users who followed a same hot Weibo(Chinese Twitter) topic, and conducted visualization of userâ€™s social relationship by drawing directed graph.

### __Software Development of Image Processing Based on MATLAB__`2017.5`
-	Designed a program with multiple functions as sharpening, smoothing and contrast enhancement, and rendered a GUI interface that enabled users to change parameters of image processing.

### __Stock Trends Prediction Based on Gaussian Process Regression__ `2017.1`
- Used GPR to capture changes in stock price with kernel function, and predicted the stock price next day based on the prices before, implemented in MATLAB.

### __Detection and Recognition of DTMF Signals__ `2016.11`
-	Detected and recognized DTMF signals based on Goertzel algorithm by C++.

### __Music Synthesis System Based on MATLAB__ `2016.6`
- Synthesized melody based on the existing music scores, and analyzed and imitated the sounds of different instruments.
