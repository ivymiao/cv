## Experience

### __Tsinghua University, Speech Processing and Machine Intelligence Lab__  `2018.3 - 2018.6`
_Research Assistant_<br>
- Advised by prof. Xi Xiao, on __Software Development of GMM-HMM Speech Recognition Based on DSP__ project
- Ported a GMM-HMM phrase speech recognition software from PC to ADI ADSP-21469 digital signal processor, and developed several driver programs to communicate with peripherals on a ADSP-21469 custom board.
- Intergrated a new function which can communicate with PC through UART to transfer information and data.
- Rewrote kernel recoginition functions in assemble languages to improve the speed of software.

### __University of California, Los Angeles, Perceptual Processing and Computational Lab__ `2017.7 - 2017.9`
_Research Assistant_<br>
- Worked with prof. Zili Liu, on __Computational Motion Processing__ project, a computational study on motion processing and learning in the brain, using support vector machines (SVM). 
- Used the best possible SVM to conduct multivarite pattern analysis on our fMRI data from the entire MT, and finally proved that suppressed MT still could process directional information under motion opponency.


## Selected Projects

### Social Network Analysis of Weibo Hot Topics Based on Python `2017.6`
- Analysed the social relationship and feature of the users who followed a same hot Weibo(Chinese Twitter) topic, and conducted visualization of userâ€™s social relationship by drawing directed graph.
